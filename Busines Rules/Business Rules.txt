Notes{
    -removed billing, surgery, feedback, medicalRecord
    -added contanctInfo (for data repetition)
    -added Person (also for data repetition) but idk if its addition in this system is smart or               
        not
    -appointment entity might be getting too long
    -swap out insurance for medicalRecord?
    -remove the relation hospital:docotr?
        because doctors are already linked to the hospital via department
        and nurse/staff/Manager aren't linked to begin with
